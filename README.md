Todo Demo Web App
=================

This repository contains a small Todo list web application.  It is a complete web stack from frontend to server to database.

Setup
-----

It depends only on Java 8 and Maven to build and run.

For details on installing Java 8 and an IDE that includes Maven, see the [OOSE Tools] page.

The lecture that goes with this code is the [OOSE Web Java Lecture].


Usage
-----

The code should be directly importable as an existing Maven project into Eclipse or IntelliJ, and should directly run from within the IDE.

If you instead want to compile and run from the command line, assuming you have the Maven command line installed:

```mvn package
java -jar target/todoapp1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```

Now simply point your browser to http://localhost:8080 to use the application.
